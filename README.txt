README for Friends Asylum Project

Quakers and Mental Health Project files

This site uses a PostreSQL database.  (We originally had a sqlite database).


The backend of this site uses the Django framework (documentation can be found at https://www.djangoproject.com/).

The frontend of this site uses Foundation5 (the complete download). The documentation for Foundation can be found at http://foundation.zurb.com/develop/download.html.

The features/visualizations on this site were made using the following libraries:

-JQuery (http://jquery.com/)
-D3 (http://d3js.org/)
-DataTables (https://www.datatables.net/)
-PDF Object (http://pdfobject.com/)

To learn more about how I got started with Django, Foundation, and creating this site, please visit my wiki page on github here: https://github.com/HCDigitalScholarship/FriendsAsylum/wiki/Welcome-and-Introduction-to-QMH-and-Django

Data, Excel Docs, Etc. for Future Research on QMH:

During the  summer of 2015, Abigail Corcoran and Lindsay Silver compiled a varied array of resources dealing with data that could be obtained from the primary materials in Special Collections.  Types of information we compiled includes:

-Excel Docs with Patient Information, Asylum Information, Quaker Meeting information, Contributions to Friends Asylum information, and information on the managers of Friends Asylum
-Additionally, we have compiled many free and available  photos from Flickr Commons, as well as from a trip we took to Friends Hospital in July
-Information on materials available in Special Collections
-Ideas about future visualizations
-Abby's research essay, citations, and a few other things she wrote on the project

All of this information and data is, as of September 15, 2015, available on DSpace in a zipped folder called: Friends Asylum Info and Data.

Please ask Mike and/or Laurie, and I'm sure they will be able to help you find the information/materials you need!
